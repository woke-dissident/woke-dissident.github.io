  <h3>Upcoming Posts: Making Universities Great Again</h3>
  <p>Over the course of the summer I've spent time that I can dedicate to this project to getting my manual (up-until-now) published. This has taken a fair bit of time, so I haven't been adding any posts - news on this soon. I'm going to start posting again. Posts so far have been aimed at understanding Woke, its associated tactics and how to counter them. For the most part, tactics associated with countering wokecraft have been relatively abstract with relatively few distinct goals. Goals that are mentioned have been to stop woke advances by preventing the spread of Woke in your university mostly through respecting conventional liberal approaches to debate and decision-making. Specific goals for preventing the spread of Woke have been twofold. First, prevent Woke ideas being injected into university administrative machinery (e.g. websites, course outlines, hiring descriptions, university policies, etc.) or into any so-called "<a href = "../keyConceptsOfWokecraft.html">sites of oppression</a>." Second, reducing the number, or preventing the recruitment of, woke participants in decision-making situations. The most important target for this goal is professors because they are around for a long time and have the most influence on decision-making in most situations. These remain good goals, but there are others as well - goals to work towards to help universities function properly. As a result, upcoming posts will be more focused on how we should aim for our universities to be, instead of just working to make them less worse.</p>

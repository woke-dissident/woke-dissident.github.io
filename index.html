    <h2>Welcome to the Woke Dissident Blog</h2>

    <p>I'm a professor at a North American university. I started this blog in October 2020 to write about issues related to North American academia that I find important. I'm writing this blog under the pen name Charles Pincourt. I am writing because I am dismayed about the state of North American universities. I'd like to help people understand what is wrong with them and if they are academics, how they can try to change them.</p>

    <p>The first item of business has been blogposts related to the Critical Social Justice (Woke) perspective, which I initially released as "How to Protect against Wokecraft: A Manual." The purpose of the manual is to help those who are concerned about the Critical Social Justice perspective, but who are not very familiar with it; those who understand that something is going wrong, but don't have the background to understand and resist the Critical Social Justice perspective takeover of our universities. It was designed for academics in an academic environment, although I believe much can be transferred to other work environments. I focus on academic environments because that is what I know. As such, the content of the website draws on significant research into the Critical Social Justice perspective and movement. It also draws on my experience in academia and how I have seen Critical Social Justice proponents advance their cause within the academy. I welcome any comments on the posts and in particular any suggested additions; of concepts, of posts, of CSJ tactics and how to counter them.</p>

    <p>The goal is to help those concerned to understand the CSJ perspective, what drives it, identify when and how it makes inroads, and how to resist and prevent it from taking over your department, faculty or university. Many would say it is too late. While there have been many inroads, the takeover until now has been largely in fine arts, the humanities and most of the social sciences. While rolling it back may be difficult in these disciplines, it is not too late to protect the sciences, engineering and business schools.

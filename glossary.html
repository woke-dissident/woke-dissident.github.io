    <h2>The Woke Glossary</h2>
    There are many technical terms used in describing, analyzing and understanding how to resist the Critical Social Justice (CSJ) perspective on this blog. I've collected them into a glossary here.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Advance:</b> An advance is an attempt to realize a goal (see below). Advances are characterized by different degrees of forcefulness.</li>
      <li><b>Goal:</b> Shorthand for Critical Social Justice goal. Goals can be short- and long-term with short-term goals being less ambitious than long-term goals. While the long-term CSJ goal may be to overthrow structures of oppression inherent in universities, short-term goals may be as simple as including the word "critical" in a course outline.</li>
      <li><b>Incursion:</b> A successful CSJ advance.</li>
      <li><b>Participants:</b> Those who are present and who participate in situations.</li>
      <li><b>Sites of Oppression:</b> Actual and figurative locations where oppression is believed to exist. They can be physical locations, but the notion is much broader than that. Oppression can be contained in course curricula, an application form, or in the content of a website. Any such "place" where oppression can be seen to exist, and therefore problematized and opposed, is a "site" of oppression. The situations described and explained in this blog are those that revolve around sites of oppression.
      <li><b>Situation:</b> Events in which the professoriat have decision-making abilities. Situations include departmental assemblies, departmental academic committees, hiring committees and all other committees and bodies in the university with professorial representation and where professors can formally influence decisions (faculties, senates, boards of governors, etc.).</li>
      <li><b>Wokecraft:</b> Term that evokes covert strategies and techniques used in other specialized fields like spycraft in espionage, but is used by woke professors to advance Critical Social Justice advances and goals in academia.
    </ul>
